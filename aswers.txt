🧠 Network Exceptions Across OSI Layers
________________________________________
1️⃣ Physical & Data Link Layer
Description:
These layers handle the physical transmission of data (cables, Wi-Fi, network cards).
Python doesn’t directly interact with them, but low-level hardware or interface errors appear as OSError.
Common Exception:
OSError: [Errno 101] Network is unreachable
Example:
import socket

try:
    # Trying to connect using an invalid or disconnected network interface
    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.connect(("10.255.255.1", 8080))  # Non-routable address
except OSError as e:
    print("Physical/Data Link Layer Error:", e)
Output:
Physical/Data Link Layer Error: [Errno 101] Network is unreachable
________________________________________
2️⃣ Network Layer
Description:
Handles logical addressing (IP) and routing.
DNS resolution and unreachable networks are typical causes of network-layer exceptions.
Common Exception:
socket.gaierror (Get Address Info Error)
Example:
import socket

try:
    s = socket.create_connection(("nonexistent-domain.example", 80))
except socket.gaierror as e:
    print("Network Layer Error: DNS resolution failed ->", e)
Output:
Network Layer Error: DNS resolution failed -> [Errno -2] Name or service not known
________________________________________
3️⃣ Transport Layer
Description:
Responsible for reliable data transfer (TCP/UDP).
Errors occur when connections time out, are refused, or are reset.
Common Exceptions:
socket.timeout
ConnectionRefusedError
ConnectionResetError
BrokenPipeError
Example:
import socket

try:
    s = socket.create_connection(("example.com", 81), timeout=3)
except socket.timeout:
    print("Transport Layer Error: Connection timed out.")
except ConnectionRefusedError:
    print("Transport Layer Error: Connection refused by server.")
except ConnectionResetError:
    print("Transport Layer Error: Connection reset by peer.")
Output (example):
Transport Layer Error: Connection refused by server.
________________________________________
4️⃣ Session Layer
Description:
Manages sessions between hosts (establishing, maintaining, terminating).
Errors appear when the session is dropped, aborted, or times out.
Common Exceptions:
ConnectionResetError
ConnectionAbortedError
TimeoutError
Example:
import socket

try:
    s = socket.create_connection(("example.com", 80))
    s.sendall(b"GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: example.com\r\n\r\n")
    # Force close to simulate a dropped session
    s.close()
    s.sendall(b"More data")  # Send after closing
except BrokenPipeError:
    print("Session Layer Error: Broken pipe (session closed).")
except ConnectionResetError:
    print("Session Layer Error: Connection reset during session.")
Output:
Session Layer Error: Broken pipe (session closed).
________________________________________
5️⃣ Presentation Layer
Description:
Handles data encoding, compression, and encryption (SSL/TLS).
Python throws errors when SSL certificates fail or when data encoding fails.
Common Exceptions:
ssl.SSLError
UnicodeDecodeError
Example 1 – SSL Error:
import ssl, socket

context = ssl.create_default_context()
try:
    with socket.create_connection(("expired.badssl.com", 443)) as sock:
        with context.wrap_socket(sock, server_hostname="expired.badssl.com") as ssock:
            print(ssock.version())
except ssl.SSLError as e:
    print("Presentation Layer Error (SSL):", e)
Output:
Presentation Layer Error (SSL): [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate has expired
Example 2 – Encoding Error:
try:
    data = b'\xff\xfe\xfd'.decode('utf-8')
except UnicodeDecodeError as e:
    print("Presentation Layer Error (Encoding):", e)
Output:
Presentation Layer Error (Encoding): 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xff
________________________________________
6️⃣ Application Layer
Description:
The layer where applications communicate (HTTP, FTP, SMTP, etc.).
Most errors here occur during API calls, HTTP requests, or data parsing.
Common Exceptions:
requests.exceptions.ConnectionError
requests.exceptions.Timeout
json.JSONDecodeError
urllib.error.URLError
Example:
import requests, json

try:
    response = requests.get("https://invalidurl.example", timeout=3)
    data = response.json()
except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError:
    print("Application Layer Error: Unable to connect to server.")
except requests.exceptions.Timeout:
    print("Application Layer Error: Server did not respond in time.")
except json.JSONDecodeError:
    print("Application Layer Error: Invalid JSON received.")
Output:
Application Layer Error: Unable to connect to server.

exceptions?

Section 4: Find the Error
1. Code:
```python
s = socket.socket
```
Error: Missing parentheses.
Fix:
```python
s = socket.socket()
```
2. Code:
```python
s.listen()
s.bind(('localhost', 8080))
```
Error: Must bind before listen.
Fix:
```python
s.bind(('localhost', 8080))
s.listen(5)
```
3. Code:
```python
client.send('Hello')
```
Error: Must send bytes, not str.
Fix:
```python
client.send(b'Hello')
```
4. Code:
```python
data = s.recv()
```
Error: recv() requires a buffer size.
Fix:
```python
data = s.recv(1024)
```
5. Code:
```python
s.connect('localhost', 8080)
```
Error: connect() needs a tuple (host, port).
Fix:
```python
s.connect(('localhost', 8080))
```
6. Code:
```python
socket.bind(('127.0.0.1', 9000))
```
Error: bind() must be called on the socket instance, not the module.
Fix:
```python
s = socket.socket()
s.bind(('127.0.0.1', 9000))
```
7. Code:
```python
s = socket.socket()
s.accept()
```
Error: You must call listen() first on a server socket before accept().
Fix:
```python
s.listen(5)
conn, addr = s.accept()
```
8. Code:
```python
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.send(b'data')
```
Error: Cannot send before the socket is connected (client) or before accept() returns a connected socket (server).
Fix (client example):
```python
s.connect(('localhost', 8080))
s.send(b'data')
```
9. Code:
```python
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
s.listen(5)
```
Error: UDP sockets do not use listen().
Fix: use UDP-style send/receive, e.g.:
```python
s.sendto(b'data', ('localhost', 8080))
data, addr = s.recvfrom(1024)
```
10. Code:
```python
s.bind(('localhost', '8080'))
```
Error: Port must be an integer, not a string.
Fix:
```python
s.bind(('localhost', 8080))
```
